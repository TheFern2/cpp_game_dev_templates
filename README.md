# cpp game dev templates

One of the things I dread when programming in cpp is the setup. In the process of learning game dev I came up with some quick templates. (Disclaimer, I don't know everything about cmake, there might be better ways, but this works for me quite well)

- sfml_test (barebones)
- sfml_01 (config, and logging)
- sdl2_test (barebones)
- sdl2_01 (config, and logging)
- sdl2_02 (added sdl2_image)

## Other demos

- chess_test (original source: https://github.com/JuUnland/Chess)
